<p>Satisfying our demand for seafood is causing untold damage to the natural function of our ecosystems.
Our oceans arerapidly being depleted of fish and many species forced to the brink of economic extinction. 
The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that nearly 80% of the world fish stocks are being exploited at
or beyond sustainable levels. Other prized seafood commodities, such as sharks fin, are captured using cruel and
unethical methods.constructor</p>
<p>
Singapore is a major seafood consumer nation in the Asia Pacific region. Most of our seafood is imported and much
is sourced from an important and fragile marine ecosystem on our doorstep known as the Coral Triangle. Today
our oceans are under more pressure than ever from human and environmental impacts. Unsustainable fishing practices
are removing fish from the oceans faster than they can be replenished.</p>
<p>
The WWF network promotes sustainable seafood by working along the entire 'chain of custody' - from ocean to the
plate. Consumers are a vital link in this chain.</p>
